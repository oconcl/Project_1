## Project Overview
  Our objective is to analyze historical stock market data from alpaca and yahoo finance, specifically on Tesla Stock, and develop a machine leanring model that can predict stock market price movement.
## Data Collection
  Gathering data every half hour, daily, and weekly.
## Processing of Data
* Handling Missing Data: Fill or drop missing values using pandas.
* Feature Selection: Choose relevant features that could influence stock prices, like previous days' prices, moving averages, or technical indicators.
## Exploratory Data Analysis
## Statistical Analysis 
## Machine Learning Developments
*Model Selection: Experiment with different models suitable for time series forecasting, like ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks), or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs).
*Feature Engineering: Incorporate lag features, moving averages, and RSI (Relative Strength Index).
*Training and Testing: Employ scikit-learn and deep learning libraries like tensorflow or keras for model training. Use a rolling forecast origin for more accurate time series forecasting.
